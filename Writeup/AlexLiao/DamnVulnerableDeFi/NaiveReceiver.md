# Challenge - Naive Receiver

Thereâ€™s a pool with 1000 WETH in balance offering flash loans. It has a fixed fee of 1 WETH. The pool supports meta-transactions by integrating with a permissionless forwarder contract.

A user deployed a sample contract with 10 WETH in balance. Looks like it can execute flash loans of WETH.

## Objective of CTF

All funds are at risk! Rescue all WETH from the user and the pool, and deposit it into the designated recovery account.

## Vulnerability Analysis

### Root Cause 1: Untrusted Flashloan Initiator

The `onFlashLoan` function in the `FlashLoanReceiver` contract is an implementation of the `IERC3156FlashBorrower` interface. However, in this implementation, the `initiator` and `data` parameters are completely ignored. Additionally, the function lacks any restrictions on who can initiate the flash loan.

Since there are no restrictions on who can initiate flash loans, and each flash loan incurs a fixed fee of 1 WETH, an attacker can continuously initiate flash loans on behalf of the `FlashLoanReceiver`. This process will eventually drain all the WETH from the `FlashLoanReceiver` contract.

The prototype for the `onFlashLoan` function in the `IERC3156FlashBorrower` interface is:

```solidity
function onFlashLoan(
    address initiator,
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 fee,
    bytes calldata data
) external returns (bytes32);
```

The implementation of the `onFlashLoan` function in the `FlashLoanReceiver` contract is as follows:

```solidity
function onFlashLoan(address, address token, uint256 amount, uint256 fee, bytes calldata) external returns (bytes32)
{
    assembly {
        // gas savings
        if iszero(eq(sload(pool.slot), caller())) {
            mstore(0x00, 0x48f5c3ed)
            revert(0x1c, 0x04)
        }
    }

    if (token != address(NaiveReceiverPool(pool).weth())) revert NaiveReceiverPool.UnsupportedCurrency();

    uint256 amountToBeRepaid;
    unchecked {
        amountToBeRepaid = amount + fee;
    }

    _executeActionDuringFlashLoan();

    // Return funds to pool
    WETH(payable(token)).approve(pool, amountToBeRepaid);

    return keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan");
}
```

### Root Cause 2: Arbitrary Address Spoofing

The `NaiveReceiverPool` contract supports meta-transactions (ERC-2771) and designates the `BasicForwarder` contract as a trusted forwarder. When interacting with `NaiveReceiverPool` via meta-transactions, the forwarder sends transactions on behalf of the user. However, in this context, the `msg.sender` during the transaction becomes the forwarder. To preserve the original user address, the forwarder appends the user's address to the end of the user's request in the `request.data`, as shown in the following code snippet:

```solidity
bytes memory payload = abi.encodePacked(request.data, request.from);
```

When `NaiveReceiverPool` needs to retrieve the `msg.sender`, it does so by parsing the data through the `msgSender()` function, which reconstructs the original user address. The code for this is as follows:

```solidity
function _msgSender() internal view override returns (address) {
    if (msg.sender == trustedForwarder && msg.data.length >= 20) {
        return address(bytes20(msg.data[msg.data.length - 20:]));
    } else {
        return super._msgSender();
    }
}
```

The `_msgSender()` function checks whether the `msg.sender` is the forwarder and if the length of `msg.data` is at least 20 bytes. If both conditions are met, it returns the last 20 bytes of `msg.data` as the `msg.sender`.

At this point, we understand how `msg.sender` is retrieved in the meta-transactions mode, but this is not sufficient to enable `msg.sender` spoofing. To achieve arbitrary `msg.sender` spoofing, we need to use the `multicall` function provided by `NaiveReceiverPool`, as shown in the following code:

```solidity
function multicall(bytes[] calldata data) external virtual returns (bytes[] memory results) {
    results = new bytes[](data.length);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
        results[i] = Address.functionDelegateCall(address(this), data[i]);
    }
    return results;
}
```

### Attack steps:

1. Exhaust all WETH in the receiver contract by initiating a flashloan. Now, `NaiveReceiverPool` has 1,010 WETH.
2. Craft a calldata to bypass `_msgSender()` and call the `withdraw()` function in `NaiveReceiverPool` to withdraw all WETH from the developer to the player.
3. Transfer all WETH from the player to the recovery.
