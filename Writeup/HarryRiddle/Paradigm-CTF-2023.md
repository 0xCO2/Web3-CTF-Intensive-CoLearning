**Hello World**

- Description: To solve this challenge, we just send minus `13.37 ether` to `TARGET` contract.

```javascript
    function isSolved() external view returns (bool) {
@>      return TARGET.balance > STARTING_BALANCE + 13.37 ether;
    }
```

**Grains of sand**

- Description: To solve this challenge, we will need to take token out of `TOKENSTORES` contract.

```javascript
    function isSolved() external view returns (bool) {
@>      return INITIAL_BALANCE - TOKEN.balanceOf(TOKENSTORE) >= 11111e8;
    }
```

`0xC937f5027D47250Fa2Df8CbF21F6F88E98817845` contract belongs to `XGR` token on mainnet. We will explore the bugs in the transactions list.

In the Token contract:

```javascript
    uint256 public transactionFeeRate   = 20; // 0.02 %
    uint256 public transactionFeeRateM  = 1e3; // 1000
    uint256 public transactionFeeMin    =   2000000; // 0.2 XGR
    uint256 public transactionFeeMax    = 200000000; // 2.0 XGR
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount, bytes extraData) external returns (bool success) {
        _transfer(msg.sender, to, amount, true, extraData);
        return true;
    }
    function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount, bool fee, bytes extraData) internal {
        bool _success;
        uint256 _fee;
        uint256 _payBack;
        uint256 _amount = amount;
        uint256 balance = TokenDB(databaseAddress).balanceOf(from);
        uint256 lockedBalance = TokenDB(databaseAddress).lockedBalances(from);
        balance = safeSub(balance, lockedBalance);
        require( _amount > 0 && balance > 0 );
        require( from != 0x00 && to != 0x00 );
        if( fee ) {
            (_success, _fee) = getTransactionFee(amount);
            require( _success );
            if ( balance == amount ) {
                _amount = safeSub(amount, _fee);
            }
        }
        require( balance >= safeAdd(_amount, _fee) );
        if ( fee ) {
            Burn(from, _fee);
        }
        Transfer(from, to, _amount);
        Transfer2(from, to, _amount, extraData);
        require( TokenDB(databaseAddress).transfer(from, to, _amount, _fee) );
    }
    function getTransactionFee(uint256 value) public constant returns (bool success, uint256 fee) {
        fee = safeMul(value, transactionFeeRate) / transactionFeeRateM / 100;
        if ( fee > transactionFeeMax ) { fee = transactionFeeMax; }
        else if ( fee < transactionFeeMin ) { fee = transactionFeeMin; }
        return (true, fee);
    }
```

Fee calculation is as follows:

```javascript
fee = (value * 20) / 1000 / 100;
transactionFeeMin = 2e8;
transactionFeeMax = 0.2e8;
```

So, the fee is minus `0.2e8` on any transfers.

In order to hit the max transaction fee `2e8`, we'd need the following the amount of tokens:

```javascript
value = (2e8 * 100 * 1000) / 20; = 10000e8
```

With `2e8` transaction fee, we'd need to perform `11111e8 / 2e8 = 5555.5 = 5556` withdrawals of 10,000 tokens. Unless we can buy 55.5 million tokens (not realistic at all), we'll have to resort to abusing the minimum transaction fee of `0.02e8` in some way

- We can now come up with an initial plan:
  - Gain access to token by fulfilling old sell orders using our 1,000 ETH.
  - Withdraw one WEI of token repeatedly from the `TOKENSTORE` contract until we've forced the `TOKENSTORE` contract to pay `11111e8` tokens in fees. We'd then have met the `isSolved()` condition.

However, we should do math again because something was wrong in the doing time. If we continuously withdraw 1 token in order to make the `TOKENSTORE` contract to pay `0.02e8` fee, we'll need to withdraw `11111e8 / 0.02e8 = 555550` times. In my testing, I could withdraw ~ over 1,000 times in a single transaction before running out of gas. At a rate of approximately 8 seconds per transaction, we get:

1,000 withdrawals = `0.02 * 1000 = 20` token every 8 seconds
`11111 / 20 = 555.55` = 556 transactions required
556 transactions \* 8 seconds = 4,448 seconds required = 74 minutes.

Unfortunately, we only have 1440 seconds for the instance provided to us to solve this problem. So, we hope to buy a large enough amount of token from the `TOKENSTORE` contract.

- Attack Implementation - Find sell orders to fulfill.

We will query all events on the `TOKENSTORE` contract by [Dune](https://dune.com/)

```sql
    SELECT contract_address, topic0, data, tx_hash
    FROM ethereum.logs
    WHERE contract_address = 0x1ce7ae555139c5ef5a57cc8d814a867ee6ee33d8 AND topic0 = 0x3314c351c2a2a45771640a1442b843167a4da29bd543612311c031bbfb4ffa98 AND bytearray_position(data, 0xc937f5027d47250fa2df8cbf21f6f88e98817845) > 0 AND bytearray_substring(data, 1, 31) = 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

There are a few things:

1. `XGR` token contract exists in the event-log data.
2. The first 32 bytes in the event-log data are all zeros. It means that selling `XGR` tokens for `ETH` tokens

We found 2 appropriate orders needs to fulfill

1. [Order-1](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1483f5c6158dfb9a899b137ccfa988fb2b1f6927854dcd83e0a29caadd0e38ba) - 100 XGR sold, 2,000 XGR up for sale total
2. [Order-2](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6d727f761c7744bebf4a8773f5a06cd7af280dcda0b55c0995aea47d5570f1a1) - 1,000 XGR sold, 10,000 XGR up for sale total

So, if we can fulfill both these orders, weâ€™d have access to 10,900 XGR total (because we have to take away the amount of XGR that was already sold in those transactions). That would then require us to abuse the fee-on-transfer functionality to drain `11111 - 10900 = 211 XGR`.

At a rate of 20 XGR per transaction (discussed above), that would take 11 transactions = ~88 seconds.
After that, we can just withdraw the rest of the tokens from the TOKENSTORE contract and solve the challenge.
