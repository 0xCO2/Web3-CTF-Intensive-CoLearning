# 0xLasadie

1. 自我介绍  
   Hello, I am [0xLasadie](https://x.com/0xlasadie) and I have been working full time in Web2 cybersecurity for a few years. Currently, I am learning more about Web3 security in hopes of pivoting over some day. I am signing up for this to have more accountability in my learning journey as well as to meet other peers. I can speak both English and Chinese language (I'll probably need more practice in Chinese 😆). Cheers
   
3. 你认为你会完成本次残酷学习吗？  
   Yes. I think I should be able to complete the challenge 💪
