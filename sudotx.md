## Notes

<!-- Content_START -->

### 2024.08.29

The goal is to finish the damn vulnerable defi v4 challenges.

starting with unstoppable, but off to a slow start as i spent the most of the days session on this level. but i learnt more about ERC-4626 and ERC-3156 standards used here

### 2024.08.30

today i wrapped up with the unstoppable challenge, and completed one more challenge (Side Entrance), Currently working on the Puppet level. the notes are <https://github.com/sudotx/Web3-CTF-Intensive-CoLearning/blob/main/Writeup/sudotx/DamnVulnerableDefi>

### 2024.08.31

today i practiced the Puppet v1 level, i was able to deduce the challenge by triggering a price manipulation by making a swap on the uniswap pair and changing its balance of tokens. therefore tampering with the price on the lending pool allowing me to take a position at the current hiked rate.

### 2024.09.2

i picked up from the momentum of the last session and dug deeper into the v2 and v3 puppet challenges
